# RBGreaterAgain

This project was created to redesign the rbglive page (https://live.rbg.tum.de/).
It uses HTML-Scraping to get the necessary information from the original page and then wraps it into a modern, dark-themed UI.
Currently you can watch live streams and VoDs via the custom UI, Archives are not covered yet.

### Planned Features
- Download Button
- Mobile Optimization
